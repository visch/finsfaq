## CHESS ADVICE

#### What should I do as an adult beginner to get better at chess?
Set modest goals, play a lot, & analyze your own games before using an engine.[^fn-adult_beginner]

[^fn-adult_beginner]: [*Chess.com Streamers Challenge - John Bartholomew*](https://youtu.be/dpSYSZ9nqgk?t=2h26m59s), 2:26:59. September 16, 2015.

#### What should I do to get better at calculation?
Play a lot of standard games (15 minute games with a 10 second increment or longer) and analyze them.[^fn-better_calc_1] Also, study your tactics and check [the book section](#books-and-resources) for some recommendations.[^fn-better_calc_2]

[^fn-better_calc_1]: [*Chess.com Streamers Challenge - John Bartholomew*](https://youtu.be/dpSYSZ9nqgk?t=2h33m50s), 2:33:50. September 16, 2015.
[^fn-better_calc_2]: [*Sunday Q+A Show on Chess.com!*](https://youtu.be/ebEOIi-tcBg?t=40m24s), 40:24. May 1, 2016.

#### When you analyze/study a game, what steps do you go through?
With your own games, John likes a 3-part process:

1. After you finish, write down your thoughts on the game and do a quick analysis of the game's big moments.
2. After some time, come back to the game and do some hardcore analysis.
3. Check your work with an engine.[^fn-analyze]

[^fn-analyze]: [*Sunday Q+A Show on Chess.com!*](https://youtu.be/ebEOIi-tcBg?t=23m40s), 23:40. May 1, 2016.

#### Any tips for chess tournaments?
Get lots of sleep. Prep your openings to anticipate where you might have weak spots. And work on your calcuation (tactics). If you're used to playing only online, pull out a physical chess set and do some work OTB to get the feel for the difference between playing on a screen and playing on a board.[^fn-tourney_prep]
