## CHESS ADVICE

#### What should I do as an adult beginner to get better at chess?
Set modest goals, play a lot, & analyze your own games before using an engine.[^fn-adult_beginner]

[^fn-adult_beginner]: [*Chess.com Streamers Challenge - John Bartholomew*](https://youtu.be/dpSYSZ9nqgk?t=2h26m59s), 2:26:59. September 16, 2015.

#### What should I do to get better at calculation?
Play a lot of standard games (15 minute games with a 10 second increment or longer) and analyze them.[^fn-better_calc_1] Also, study your tactics and check [the book section](#books-and-resources) for some recommendations.[^fn-better_calc_2]

[^fn-better_calc_1]: [*Chess.com Streamers Challenge - John Bartholomew*](https://youtu.be/dpSYSZ9nqgk?t=2h33m50s), 2:33:50. September 16, 2015.
[^fn-better_calc_2]: [*Sunday Q+A Show on Chess.com!*](https://youtu.be/ebEOIi-tcBg?t=40m24s), 40:24. May 1, 2016.

#### When you analyze/study a game, what steps do you go through?
With your own games, John likes a 3-part process:

1. After you finish, write down your thoughts on the game and do a quick analysis of the game's big moments.
2. After some time, come back to the game and do some hardcore analysis.
3. Check your work with an engine.[^fn-analyze]
